# kaggle
Includes Jupiter notebooks (python) and snippets of code showing my process of improving simple machine learning models I completed with the help of Kaggle courses. This is a continuation of my machine learning and data science journey.

### Intro/Intermediate Machine Learning

What I Learned (I will be continuously updating this list as I continue my project):
- Pandas and Sci-kit learn (Decision Trees + Random Forest Models)
- Dealing with missing values (numerical only)
- Using categorical variables
- Practical ML (e.g. organizing data, model-validation, training models)
